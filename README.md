 Both IVT and Non-IVT traffic show similar overall request patterns, indicating that the IVT sources closely mimic real app behavior.
 However, the IVT Detected traffic has a lower idfa_ua_ratio, meaning it uses a larger variety of User-Agents â€” a sign of bots randomizing device signatures to bypass detection.
 This suggests a more sophisticated type of invalid traffic, where device and IP activity appears normal but UA diversity reveals the anomaly.
